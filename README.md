# dotfiles

Just a collection of my dotfiles.... trying to get them somewhat organized and reproducible.

The particular dotfiles repo has a "link_dotfiles.sh" script that must be run from the dotfiles directory... and will blindly remove the original dotfile in your HOME directory, and then symbolically link to the one in this repo.

Most of these are generic enough for general use. Some are likely to contain things that are completely useless to others.

For internal systems, functions and information, I'll eventually create a system that will call a local config file that can be appended or whatever .

For now, it's just a naive simple start... I'll find my collection of them as I start re-creating them again.
